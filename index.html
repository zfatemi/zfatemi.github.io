          <li> The global economic elite are bribing politicans to pass legislation that benefits their own interests, over the interests of the people, while simultaneously exploiting the consolodation of media to push naratives that marginalize and demonize ethnic/racial groups, blaming them for the social/economic problems that the elite themselves created and then using law enforcement and the inteligence apparatus to attack legitimate protesters, and to gaslight anyone brazen enough to speak out against their total hegemony over all aspects of our lives! Grab your torches and pitch-forks and show them who's boss! </li>
